<h1> Effie's Top 3 Movies </h1>
<h2> My 3 favorite movies of all time </h2>
<hr /> 
<h3> Mamma Mia  </h3>
<p> This movie is a great pick me up. Its so fun to watch and sing along with since it is a musical. Its light hearted and hilarious.</p>
<h3> Girl Interrupted </h3>
<p> I love this movie. Its an emotional and hard to watch story but crucial as it looks into more of the harder parts of growing up and being an adult. </p>
<h3> Burlesque </h3>
<p> This movie is awesome and musically entertaining. It reminds me of why I love Christina Aguilera & Cher so much. </p>
